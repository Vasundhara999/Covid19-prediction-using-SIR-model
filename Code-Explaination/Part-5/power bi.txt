Power BI is a visualization tool, which loads, transforms, and visualizes data. In this project, we have used Power BI for loading data from Snowflake and then visualizing it.<br><br>

Download Power BI Desktop on your system<br>

Different Downloads are available according to different usage, but for our use, we only need to load and visualize, So Power BI Desktop is the best option available.
<br>Microsoft Store will open with Power BI Desktop download page, or you can also search for the same on Store
